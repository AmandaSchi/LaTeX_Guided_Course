The best way to learn how to program is to do something useful,
so this introduction to LaTeX is built around a common scientific task:
**publication preparation**.

### Unformatted Text

We are preparing an unformatted text file for publication.  The document includes a description
of a trip to the Near East, Notes to Interested Researchers, Preparations of Compounds, and
Elliptical Formula Derivation.

So, we want to:

1. Format symbols in the text to be rendered properly in a final document
2. Organize the content in a logical manner
3. Add important details to the content
4. Present a final document, suitable for publication

To do all that, we'll have to learn a little bit about document creation.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> You need to understand the concepts of **files** and **directories** and how to start a LaTeX
> compiler before tackling this lesson. This lesson sometimes references Overleaf
> although you can use any LaTeX compiler mentioned in the [Setup](setup/).
>
> The commands in this lesson pertain to **LaTeX2e**.  Compilation will be done with **pdflatex**

### Getting Started
To get started, follow the directions on the "[Setup](setup/)" page to download data.  If you are
using Overleaf, you will not have to download a LaTeX compiler to your computer.  If you already
have a preferred editor, you can use that.
