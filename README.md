# LaTeX_Guided_Course
This repository contains everything needed for a step-by-step LaTeX course to be taught in the 'Carpentry' style.

This instructional session is editor agnostic.  It is assumed that a novice user will not have preferences on
this topic.  Additonally, the novice user is unlikely to have any compiler on the user's computer before
attending a workshop.  This instruction set makes use of an online editor [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).
Use of the online editor prevents the user from being expected to download a large (~4.5 Gb complete install)
program before attending course.

This instructional session assumes the user is aware of LaTeX and the benefits of it's use.  It does not attempt
to 'sell' the user on LaTeX over other options.  Comparisons to other document creation programs (e.g. Microsoft
Word) is discouraged.
