exercises: 00

questions:
- "How do I use equations in LaTeX?"

objectives:
- "Explain the way to activate math mode in-line and as an environment"
- "Render sample math text in LaTeX"
- "Learn how to represent some common symbols with math"
- "Apply superscripts, subscripts, and similar symbolic nomenclature"
- "Learn how to to properly employ braces"
- "Create fractions properly"
- "Align equations over multiple lines"
- "Break a long equation across multiple lines"

keypoints:
- "Activate the math environment with `equation`"

- "Use the math environment without creating a numbered equation using `equation*` and `[]`"
- "Enter Greek symbols such as `phi` with escape sequencies in math mode"
- "Distinguish super- and sub- levels of script with `^` and `_`"
- "Create an integral with `int` which is bound by text using `^` and `_`"
- "Recognize that mathematical symbols such as `cos` and `sin` must be escaped sequences"
- "Use `left(`, `right(`, and similar brace sequences to dynamically bound math"
- "Create fractions with the `frac` command instead of `/`"
- "Align a multistep sequence using the `align` and `split` environments using `&` helpers"
- "Include plaintext portions of aligned math using the `array` environment with `&{}` helpers"
- "Break a long equation up with `multline`"
