## Rules of Debugging

1.  Fail early, fail often.
2.  Always initialize from data.
3.  Know what it's supposed to do.
4.  Make it fail every time.
5.  Make it fail fast.
6.  Change one thing at a time, for a reason.
7.  Keep track of what we've done.
8.  Be humble.
9.  Test the simple things first.

And remember,
a week of hard work can sometimes save you an hour of thought.

## Places to Look for Help

 - [LaTeX Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) - This wikibook is one of the best online
resources for information about using LaTeX.  Start here for resources.  It is not definitive,
and it is not perfect, but it is organized in a manner which is conducive to finding what you need
then figuring out how to make it work.

 - [CTAN](https://ctan.org/) - If you have problems with a specific package, find the documentation
on the package.  The CTAN repository is where information about every package is stored for the
most up-to-date versions available.  Search for your package, then read the *Package
Documentation*.  The documentation will always be in the PDF format, and labelled clearly.

 - [Overleaf Guides](https://www.overleaf.com/learn) - Overleaf (formerly also ShareLaTeX) run their
business off of people using LaTeX often and well.  They provide some very good guides for common
tasks in LaTeX.  Additionally, they provide documentation for how some features specific to their
site here.  If you have Overleaf specific problems, definitely check with them.

 - [The Not So Introduction Guide to LaTeX2E](http://mirrors.ctan.org/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf) -
This might be considered **The Guide** in LaTeX.  The authors of this guide have constantly
kept the contents up to date with the latest tricks and explanations for how to get things to
work.  The contents are dense and to the point, reminiscent of other authoritative guides for
various programming languages.  However, it may be daunting to ~~lazy~~ novice LaTeX users.

 - [TeX Stack Exchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/) - Yes, there is a Stack Exchange devoted
entirely to TeX, LaTeX, XeLaTeX, and everything in between.  The users here will be able to
answer any question posed.  However, **read the manuals first**.  The Stack Exchange community
expects well formed answers, it is not for things that can be found if you had just read a bit
more.  They will not do your work for you.  Proper ettiquette should be observed on this site.
